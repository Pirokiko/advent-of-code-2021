This will represent abcdefg as the input of the question and use ABCDEFG as the representation for the RESULTS

Patterns:
acedgfb
cdfbe
gcdfa
fbcad
dab
cefabd
cdfgeb
eafb
cagedb
ab

Unique number patterns:
1, 4, 7, 8

1 = ab
4 = eafb
7 = dab
8 = acedgfb

A = letters for 7 - letters for 1
A = d
Now remove A from all patterns as we know what A is already

acegfb  + A=d
cfbe    + A=d
gcfa    + A=d
fbca    + A=d
ab      + A=d
cefab   + A=d
cfgeb   + A=d
eafb
cageb   + A=d
ab


Set of patterns with length of 6
cefab   + A=d                   0: 5    => BCEFG    + A
cfgeb   + A=d                   6: 5    => BDEFG    + A
cageb   + A=d                   9: 5    => BCDFG    + A

C, D & E (a, f & g) are the chars which occur in 2 patterns
With the C, D & E chars as options,
C = char which is present in the pattern for 1 (CF = ab)
C = a
D & E (f & g) = chars which are NOT present in the pattern for 1 (CF = ab)
    D = char which is present in pattern for 4 (BCDF = eafb)
    D = f
    E = char which is NOT present in pattern for 4 (BCDF = eafb)
    E = g
F = other char of the pattern for 1 (CF = ab) which is not C char
F = b


Remove all known chars

ce   + A=d C=a D=f E=g F=b
ce   + A=d D=f F=b
c    + A=d C=a D=f E=g
c    + A=d C=a D=f F=b
     + A=d C=a F=b
c    + A=d C=a D=f E=g F=b
ce   + A=d D=f E=g F=b
e    + C=a D=f F=b
ce   + A=d C=a E=g F=b
     + C=a F=b

The pattern of 4 (BCDF = eafb) only has a single character unsolved: B
B = e


Remove all known chars

c   + A=d C=a D=f E=g F=b B=e
c   + A=d D=f F=b B=e
c    + A=d C=a D=f E=g
c    + A=d C=a D=f F=b
     + A=d C=a F=b
c    + A=d C=a D=f E=g F=b
c   + A=d D=f E=g F=b B=e
    + C=a D=f F=b B=e
c   + A=d C=a E=g F=b B=e
     + C=a F=b

Last char is pattern for 8 (ABCDEFG = acedgfb) filtered by known values all but G
G = c


====== RESULTING TRANSLATION TABLE ======
A = d
B = e
C = a
D = f
E = g
F = b
G = c
